## 🔧 Technical Details

### The HPOS Declaration

Added to `auto-product-import.php`:

```php
/**
 * Declare HPOS compatibility
 * 
 * Although this plugin manages product imports (not orders),
 * WooCommerce requires all active plugins to explicitly declare
 * HPOS compatibility to prevent warnings.
 */
add_action('before_woocommerce_init', function() {
    if (class_exists('\Automattic\WooCommerce\Utilities\FeaturesUtil')) {
        \Automattic\WooCommerce\Utilities\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility(
            'custom_order_tables',
            __FILE__,
            true
        );
    }
});
```

### Why This Plugin Needs HPOS Declaration

1. **WooCommerce Policy**: All active plugins must declare HPOS compatibility
2. **Prevents Warnings**: Without declaration, WordPress shows compatibility warning
3. **Already Compatible**: Plugin was always HPOS-compatible (doesn't use orders)
4. **Products Unaffected**: HPOS only affects order storage, not products
