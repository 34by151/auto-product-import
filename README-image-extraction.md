# Product Image Extraction Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the product image extraction functionality in the Auto Product Import plugin, specifically for BigCommerce sites like impactguns.com.

## Problem Statement

The original image extraction logic had several limitations:
1. It was extracting many unrelated images (icons, logos, UI elements)
2. It was only finding a subset of the actual product images
3. It didn't have special handling for BigCommerce sites
4. The images were often lower resolution than desired

## Improvements Made

### 1. Blacklist Filtering

We implemented a comprehensive blacklist of terms that typically indicate non-product images:
- UI elements (icon, logo, button, search, menu)
- Social media (facebook, twitter, instagram)
- Placeholders and decorative elements (placeholder, banner, background)
- E-commerce elements (cart, checkout, payment, shipping)
- Rating and review elements (star, rating, badge)

### 2. BigCommerce-Specific Extraction

We added specialized selectors for BigCommerce product galleries:
- Targeting the `productView-thumbnails` class which contains product thumbnails
- Supporting the `data-image-gallery-new-image-url` attribute for high-quality images
- Converting thumbnail URLs to high-resolution (1280x1280) versions

### 3. Prioritization Strategy

We implemented a multi-tier approach to image extraction:
1. First try BigCommerce-specific selectors
2. Then try common product image containers
3. Next check main content areas for product images
4. Finally scan all images with strict filtering

### 4. Validation Improvements

We improved the validation of image URLs with pattern matching:
- Identify product images by dimensions (e.g., 1280x1280)
- Detect product-specific paths in URLs (/products/, /product/)
- Filter out common non-product image formats (SVG, GIF)
- Check for image extensions (jpg, jpeg, png, webp)

### 5. DOM Safety

We addressed issues with DOM methods:
- Added safe wrappers for `getAttribute` and `hasAttribute` methods
- Improved error handling during DOM operations

## Results

The improvements successfully address the issues:
1. No longer extracts unrelated images like icons, logos, etc.
2. Successfully extracts all product images (5 out of 5 for the test URL)
3. Provides special handling for BigCommerce sites
4. Consistently returns high-resolution images

## Test Results

Testing on the URL: https://www.impactguns.com/revolvers/ruger-wrangler-22-lr-4-62-barrel-6rd-burnt-bronze-736676020041-2004

Before: Only extracted 1 product image along with unrelated images
After: Successfully extracted all 5 product images in high resolution:
1. Front view
2. Left side view
3. Right side view
4. Cylinder view
5. Box/packaging view

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:
- Support for more e-commerce platforms with specialized selectors
- Machine learning-based image recognition to identify product images
- Image quality assessment to prioritize the best images
- Performance optimizations for faster extraction
